00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.280
Hey guys, welcome to Basics with Babish where this week

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.100
things take a turn for the sweeter as we try

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.040
our hand at ice cream, specifically,

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.300
my favorite flavor, straight up chocolate.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.300
We're gonna try a few different techniques that vary in difficulty

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.540
and elbow greasedness.

7
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.940
But they all have one thing in common.

8
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.880
You don't have to buy a stand-alone appliance

9
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.580
the size of a microwave to make them.

10
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.020
Let's get down to basics.

11
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.000
[intro music]

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.980
Alright guys, so let's start with one of the easiest and most

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.080
kitchen-hack ways to make ice cream at home,

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.060
and that is with frozen bananas.

15
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.080
I've got two whole bananas here that I've cut in slices and let freeze,

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.420
until completely solid, about two hours.

17
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.100
Into the jar of a blender they go, where we

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.960
ultimately want to liquefy them, so

19
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.640
you might need to occasionally add some whole milk.

20
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.020
Just a few splashes at a time because we want this to be as thick as possible.

21
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.660
If you've got one of these neato blender plunger things, it's really helpful.

22
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.020
Just keep blending, adding milk as necessary

23
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.840
And then once it's almost liquefied we're going to add a few tablespoons of cocoa powder.

24
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.100
Two, to be precise.

25
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.600
You can adjust this to your taste for how chocolatey you like your chocolate ice cream.

26
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.540
We're gonna add a little bit more milk because I want to make this really, really smooth

27
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.920
and then we're going to blend until everything is completely incorporated.

28
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.640
Then, before you get tempted to drink your banana smoothie,

29
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.660
We're just gonna pour the whole thing into a big ol' glass or metal bowl

30
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.820
Cover it with plastic wrap so the plastic wrap is pressing down directly onto the surface

31
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.200
of the liquid, then freeze for about four hours, and that's all there is to it.

32
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.060
We'll take a look at that when it's done, but for now how about a less shortcut-oriented version,

33
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.360
that's still really, very easy.

34
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.980
It starts with a pint of heavy whipping cream,

35
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.260
whipping cream that we are going to whip into whipped cream,

36
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.700
creaming with the whisk -- Sorry, I'll stop --

37
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.480
until a stiff, thick -- I don't know, whatever this stuff is called, whip cream?

38
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.720
Then onto our faux custard base.

39
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.440
We're gonna start by emptying a 14-ounce can of sweetened, condensed milk

40
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.840
into a medium bowl.

41
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.320
You can also add an optional half-stick of melted butter for extra richness,

42
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.560
and then a few heaping tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder.

43
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.860
We're not adding any sugar here because sweetened, condensed milk has plenty of it.

44
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.580
We're just gonna gently whisk everything together until it's all nice and homogenous.

45
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.959
And taste it, if it's not chocolatey enough, add more cocoa powder.

46
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.200
We want this to be extra, extra chocolatey because

47
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.040
we're gonna be diluting it, essentially, with the whipped cream.

48
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.760
Once it's really extra super chocolatey,

49
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.380
we're gonna add the whipped cream and gently fold it into the chocolate mixture.

50
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.740
I say gently because the less we sort of, deflate the whipped cream

51
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.040
the lighter and fluffier texture our ice cream is going to have.

52
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.900
Once you've got that all completely incorporated, with no streaks,

53
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.140
go ahead and smooth out the top

54
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.820
and then, we are going to, once again, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least four hours,

55
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:37.400
ideally, overnight.

56
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And while that's chilling let's take a look at

57
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.060
the genuine article.

58
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.920
Real, honest to God, hand-churned ice cream.

59
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.800
Let's start by making our custard.

60
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.960
Into a medium saucepan, we're combining two cups of whole milk,

61
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.820
two whole eggs,

62
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.580
and one cup of white sugar, whisking to combine.

63
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.200
And then over medium-low heat, whisking constantly until it reaches 175 degrees Fahrenheit,

64
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.620
at which point we're gonna take it off the heat and add

65
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.360
about 1/3 cup of cocoa powder.

66
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.980
If you wanted to make a different flavor of ice cream, this would be the point

67
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.920
that you would add your flavorings.

68
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.640
Now both to up the richness of the mixture and to help cool it off,

69
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.980
we're going to add 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream,

70
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.840
whisking, again, to combine.

71
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.920
Give it a taste for flavor, if it tastes like melted ice cream, you're off to a good start.

72
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.500
Pour this guy into a bowl, cover with plastic wrap all the way down to the surface of the liquid

73
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.140
and throw it in the freezer, but no, we are not anywhere near done with this yet.

74
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.240
While this is cooling it's time to assemble our makeshift ice cream machine.

75
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.820
That is a very large metal bowl that we're going to fill halfway with ice.

76
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.680
If you buy bagged Bodega ice make sure that there are no big chunks stuck together,

77
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.380
just break it apart with your hands or give up and throw it at stuff until it breaks.

78
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.420
And then sprinkle the whole thing down with about 1/2 cup of salt.

79
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.820
This helps the ice more efficiently absorb heat

80
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.820
from our custard mixture, thus making ti freeze and thicken faster.

81
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.920
See, science can be cool sometimes.

82
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.760
So get our chilled custard mixture out of the freezer and take off the plastic wrap,

83
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.900
place it into the ice bowl and start a' mixin'.

84
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.600
We're gonna whisk this mixture for 10 minutes,

85
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.100
making sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl at every opportunity.

86
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.920
And then we're going to cover the whole affair with a clean kitchen towel

87
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.000
and place in the freezer for 30 minutes.

88
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.160
Then we're gonna take it back out and do it all over again,

89
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.980
a total of four times.

90
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.980
Hey, I said you weren't gonna need any special tools, I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

91
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.760
So by the end of the fourth go-around,

92
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.520
our custard should have the consistency of, like, a very soft, soft, serve.

93
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.520
At this point, we can take it out of our ice bowl,

94
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.020
cover it with plastic wrap, down to the surface of the liquid,

95
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.540
and freeze for another four hours, ideally, overnight.

96
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.840
It's been a long day, but it's time to finally sample the fruits of our labor.

97
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.780
Let's start with the banana ice cream, which

98
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.400
looks a little bit slushy, but hey, it still looks like ice cream.

99
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.640
And then our sweetened, condensed shortcut which

100
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.060
is very, very light and fluffy.

101
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.420
A bit more like gelato.

102
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.940
And then our straight up ice cream,

103
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.120
which looks, tastes, smells, sounds, and feels like ice cream.

104
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.600
Three different methods, three different amounts of time,

105
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.820
three different upper body strength requirements,

106
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.940
but all delicious, except for the banana one, which I'm not allowed to eat,

107
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.660
but my friends told me it tasted delicious.

108
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.880
But, what if we decided to go nuclear and

109
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.100
make the ultimate bowl of chocolate ice cream.

110
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.960
A Tony Soprano-sized bowl, piled high with

111
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.620
all three types that we made today.

112
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.400
Plus, how about some chocolate whipped cream?

113
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.400
Just make whipped cream as you normally would,

114
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.720
and add a few teaspoons of cocoa powder.

115
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.980
Then lay a generous dollop on top.

116
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.980
Then, just in case this ain't chocolatey enough,

117
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.040
Some freshly shaved chocolate right on top.

118
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.720
This ended up being kind of a cool Sunday,

119
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.040
different flavors and textures

120
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.400
of ice cream all in one bowl?

121
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.340
But if you ask me, nothing beats the old-fashioned recipe.

122
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.100
It's like they always say -- you get what you pay for.

123
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.440
Or, in this case, you get what you whisk for.

124
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.000
Hope you guys try this out yourselves,

125
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.480
if you want to cook it along with me, join me on Twitch,

126
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.400
this time next week, that's Thursday, July 19

127
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.640
where I will be making all three methods live.
